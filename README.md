## Synopsis

This project is  developed and submitted to satisfy the requirements of project work for the Coursera - Data  Science Course  "Getting and Cleaning Data".  

Project folder includes the following:
  * <b>run_analysis.R</b>   the R script file
  * column_subset_and_map_for_step2.txt   a  required data file used by run_analysis.R . This file contains the columns to be subset and column mapping to descriptive names.
  * project_RStudio_snip.PNG    (RStudio screen shot)
  * project_final_tidy_data_set_in_RStudio.PNG (RStudio screen shot)
  * final_tidy_data_set_screen_shot_in_RStudio.PNG (RStudio screen shot)
  * getting_and_cleaning_data_project_final_tidy_data_set.txt  . This is the final tidy dataset generated by run_analysis.R



## Code Example

The script is written in R . This project is run by setting working directory to this project folder and sourcing the script run_analysis.R . 
e.g. <br>
> setwd("C:/project_folder_containing_script")<br>
>source("run_analysis.R")<br>

## Motivation

This project is submitted for getting project credit in course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

## Installation

No installation is needed. This project uses package 'dplyr'.

## Tests

This project is to be evaluated by peers by sourcing the script  "run_analysis.R" preferably in RStudio as displays  console output and Global Environment :
>source("run_analysis.R")
